# ProMALS : Advanced Proteomic Profiling for Precision Biomarkers in ALS Prognosis and Disease Progression

### Abstract

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. This cell death leads to a gradual loss of muscle control, and usually results in death by respiratory failure within three to five year on average from symptoms onset.The Interest in biomarkers relevant to ALS has grown steadily over the past decade1. Proteomics methods based on mass spectrometry hold special promise for the discovery of novel biomarkers that might form the foundation for new clinical blood tests, but to date, they are disappointing. This is due in part to the lack of a coherent pipeline connecting marker discovery with well-established methods for validation.  
    Indeed, Better diagnostic markers for ALS are urgently needed to improve diagnosis, guide molecularly targeted therapy and monitor activity and therapeutic16, guide molecularly targeted therapy and monitor activity and therapeutic response across a wide spectrum of disease, in our case, ALS. ProMALS is developed to understand ALS through the discovery of precision protein biomarkers. This project utilizes mass spectrometry technology to identify and validate protein biomarkers from patients serum that can predict the progression of ALS and aid in prognosis, offering new possibilities for personalized therapeutic strategies.


### Aims

1.Developing candidate biomarkers from human liquid biopsies for ALS progression, based on unbiased proteomic profiling.

Hypothesis: Pathology relevant proteins can be found and analyzed in ALS patients sera as biomarkers for patients survival.

### Discovery 
I plan on exploring the relationship of proteins to patients survival with linear and non-linear models including Cox regression, Random Survival Forest and  Survival-XGBoost. Each model allows us to assess the importance of each protein in predicting a patientâ€™s survival probability, from which we can extract those that are most relevant to our outcomes.
